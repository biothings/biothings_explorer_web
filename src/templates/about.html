                <p>BioThings Explorer(BTE) is an engine for autonomously querying a distributed knowledge graph. The distributed knowledge graph is made up of biomedical APIs that have been annotated with semantically-precise descriptions of their inputs and outputs. The knowledge graph is currently comprised by the APIs in this figure</p>

                <br>
                <p>Using the Meta-KG, BTE automatically chains together queries spanning multiple APIs and assembling results, thereby organizing independently-created and -maintained APIs into a cohesive distributed knowledge graph (Distributed-KG). BTE proceeds in three steps: query path planning, query path execution, and summarization/filtering/ranking.</p>

                <h4 id="plan">Project Plan</h4>
                <p><br>The BTE system will continue to focus on autonomously answering two classes of queries by deconstructing them and relaying the components to distributed Knowledge Providers.<br>
                   The first type of query is <b>predict</b>, it seeks to find relationships between one specific entity and a class of entity types. 
                   An example of <b>predict</b> query" is:</p>
                   <blockquote>What drugs might be used to treat NGLY1-deficiency?
                    </blockquote>
                   <p>The second type of query is <b>explain</b>, which seeks to explain the relationship between two specific entities. An example of <b>explain</b> query is:</p>
                   <blockquote>What is the mechanism for imatinib's effect on asthma?
                    </blockquote>
                   <p>Both query types – <b>predict</b> and <b>explain</b> – are processed in three distinct phases.
                </p><br>
                <hr>
                <h5 id="query-path-plan">Phase 1: Query Path Planning</h5>
                <p><br>When a user query is provided, BTE will first perform query path planning. Both query types can be generalized to a common query template (which in these examples asks for all the ways in which Diseases can be connected to Drugs). </p>
                <p>In <b>Step #1</b>, BTE queries the Meta-KG for all the entity types that can join Diseases and Drugs. (For simplicity, this example restricts paths one intermediate node, but query paths can theoretically be of any length. This simplified example also does not specify predicates describing how entities are related, but those can also be incorporated into the query template as filters.) </p>
                <p>If, for example, we then focus on the Disease - Gene - Drug query metapath, <b>Step #2</b> would then make a second query on the Meta-KG, returning the specific APIs that report Disease - Gene relationships and the specific APIs that report Gene - Drug relationships. The output of this process is a query path plan (highlighted in red), which indicates which sequence of API calls can generate results that match the original query template. (Figure 3)
                    </p><br>

                <h5 id="query-path-execute">Phase 2: Query Path Execution</h5>
                <p><br>In the second query path execution phase, BTE programmatically and autonomously executes the query path plan (Figure 4). </p>
                <p>Here, BTE uses the semantic API annotations in the meta-KG to call each API with the appropriate inputs, and to map the API output to the Translator-standard <a href="https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/" >Biolink Model</a>. </p>
                <p>Moreover, BTE performs <b>ID-to-object translation</b>, which facilitates API chaining when one APIs output shares the same semantic type as another API's input (e.g., "gene"), but differs by the specific identifiers used (e.g., Entrez Gene vs Ensembl). </p><br>

                <hr>
                <h5 id="query-summarization">Phase 3: Query Summarization & Filtering</h5>
                <p><br>The third phase of BTE query execution involves summarization, filtering, and ranking. The examples shown in Figures 3 and 4 were chosen for their simplicity to illustrate BTE's technical approach. But actual user queries are likely to be more complex and to involve longer query metapaths. The BTE approach and infrastructure will scale just fine. But especially as the number and size of Knowledge Providers grows, there will be an exponential growth in the number of returned paths, easily numbering in the thousands (or even more). BTE must provide users tools to effectively manage those results. 
                </p><br>
                <p>Summarization, filtering and ranking are essential to scalable execution of BTE. Figure 5 illustrates the simplest prioritization strategy based on node and edge properties. In addition, we will describe in the milestones other approaches for ranking paths based on metrics of confidence, novelty, and/or biological plausibility. We will also introduce on new innovative approach for evaluating paths based on co-occurrence of entities within published pathway figures. Our co-PI Alex Pico (UCSF/Gladstone) developed a pipeline for performing optical character recognition (OCR) followed by named entity recognition (NER) within published figures (see <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/379446v1" target="_blank">paper</a>). Here, we will explore the expansion and use of this approach to prioritize paths returned by BTE.
